The goal of butterfly is to aid in the verification of continually
updating timeseries data, where we expect new values over time, but want
to ensure previous data remains unchanged, and timesteps remain
continuous.

Data previously recorded could change for a number of reasons, such as
discovery of an error in model code, a change in methodology or
instrument recalibration. Monitoring data sources for these changes is
not always possible.

Unnoticed changes in previous data could have unintended consequences,
such as invalidating a published dataset’s Digital Object Identfier
(DOI), or altering future predictions if used as input in forecasting
models.

Other unnoticed changes could include a jump in time or measurement
frequency, due to instrument failure or software updates.

This package provides functionality that can be used as part of a data
pipeline, to check and flag changes to previous data to prevent changes
going unnoticed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of butterfly from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("antarctica/butterfly")
```

## Overview

The butterfly package contains the following functions:

- `butterfly::loupe()` - examines in detail whether previous values have
  changed, and returns TRUE/FALSE for no change/change.
- `butterfly::catch()` - returns rows which contain previously changed
  values in a dataframe.
- `butterfly::release()` - drops rows which contain previously changed
  values, and returns a dataframe containing new and unchanged rows.
- `butterfly::create_object_list()` - returns a list of objects required
  by all of `loupe()`, `catch()` and `release()`. Contains underlying
  functionality.
- `butterfly::timeline()` - check if a timeseries is continuous between
  timesteps.
- `butterfly::timeline_group()` - group distinct, but continuous
  sequences of a timeseries.

There are also dummy datasets, which a fictional and purely to
demonstrate butterfly functionality:

- `butterflycount` - a list of monthly dataframes, which contain
  fictional butterfly counts for a given date.
- `forestprecipitation` - a list of monthly dataframes, which contain
  fictional daily precipitation measurements for a given date.
- `butterflymess` - a messy version of `butterflycount`, provided for
  testing purposes.

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to use butterfly:

``` r
library(butterfly)

# Imagine a continually updated dataset that starts in January and is updated once a month
butterflycount$january
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-01-01    22
#> 2 2023-12-01    55
#> 3 2023-11-01    11

# In February an additional row appears, all previous data remains the same
butterflycount$february
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-02-01    17
#> 2 2024-01-01    22
#> 3 2023-12-01    55
#> 4 2023-11-01    11

# In March an additional row appears again
# ...but a previous value has unexpectedly changed
butterflycount$march
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-03-01    23
#> 2 2024-02-01    17
#> 3 2024-01-01    22
#> 4 2023-12-01    55
#> 5 2023-11-01    18
```

We can use `butterfly::loupe()` to examine in detail whether previous
values have changed.

``` r
butterfly::loupe(
  butterflycount$february,
  butterflycount$january,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)
#> The following rows are new in 'df_current': 
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-02-01    17
#> ✔ And there are no differences with previous data.
#> [1] TRUE

butterfly::loupe(
  butterflycount$march,
  butterflycount$february,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)
#> The following rows are new in 'df_current': 
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-03-01    23
#> 
#> ℹ The following values have changes from the previous data.
#> old vs new
#>            count
#>   old[1, ]    17
#>   old[2, ]    22
#>   old[3, ]    55
#> - old[4, ]    18
#> + new[4, ]    11
#> 
#> `old$count`: 17.0 22.0 55.0 18.0
#> `new$count`: 17.0 22.0 55.0 11.0
#> [1] FALSE
```

`butterfly::loupe()` uses `dplyr::semi_join()` to match the new and old
objects using a common unique identifier, which in a timeseries will be
the timestep. `waldo::compare()` is then used to compare these and
provide a detailed report of the differences.

`butterfly` follows the `waldo` philosophy of erring on the side of
providing too much information, rather than too little. It will give a
detailed feedback message on the status between two objects.

### Using butterfly for data wrangling

You might want to return changed rows as a dataframe, or drop them
altogether. For this `butterfly::catch()` and `butterfly::release()` are
provided.

Here, `butterfly::catch()` only returns rows which have **changed** from
the previous version. It will not return new rows.

``` r
df_caught <- butterfly::catch(
  butterflycount$march,
  butterflycount$february,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)
#> The following rows are new in 'df_current': 
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-03-01    23
#> 
#> ℹ The following values have changes from the previous data.
#> old vs new
#>            count
#>   old[1, ]    17
#>   old[2, ]    22
#>   old[3, ]    55
#> - old[4, ]    18
#> + new[4, ]    11
#> 
#> `old$count`: 17.0 22.0 55.0 18.0
#> `new$count`: 17.0 22.0 55.0 11.0
#> 
#> ℹ Only these rows are returned.

df_caught
#>         time count
#> 1 2023-11-01    18
```

Conversely, `butterfly::release()` drops all rows which had changed from
the previous version. Note it retains new rows, as these were expected.

``` r
df_released <- butterfly::release(
  butterflycount$march,
  butterflycount$february,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)
#> The following rows are new in 'df_current': 
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-03-01    23
#> 
#> ℹ The following values have changes from the previous data.
#> old vs new
#>            count
#>   old[1, ]    17
#>   old[2, ]    22
#>   old[3, ]    55
#> - old[4, ]    18
#> + new[4, ]    11
#> 
#> `old$count`: 17.0 22.0 55.0 18.0
#> `new$count`: 17.0 22.0 55.0 11.0
#> 
#> ℹ These will be dropped, but new rows are included.

df_released
#>         time count
#> 1 2024-03-01    23
#> 2 2024-02-01    17
#> 3 2024-01-01    22
#> 4 2023-12-01    55
```

### Checking for continuity: `timeline()`

To check if a timeseries is continuous, `timeline()` and
`timeline_group()` are provided.

``` r
# A rain gauge which measures precipitation every day
butterfly::forestprecipitation$january
#>         time rainfall_mm
#> 1 2024-01-01         0.0
#> 2 2024-01-02         2.6
#> 3 2024-01-03         0.0
#> 4 2024-01-04         0.0
#> 5 2024-01-05         3.7
#> 6 2024-01-06         0.8

# In February there is a power failure in the instrument
butterfly::forestprecipitation$february
#>         time rainfall_mm
#> 1 2024-02-01         1.1
#> 2 2024-02-02         0.0
#> 3 2024-02-03         1.4
#> 4 2024-02-04         2.2
#> 5 1970-01-01         3.4
#> 6 1970-01-02         0.6
```

To check if a timeseries is continuous:

``` r
butterfly::timeline(
   forestprecipitation$january,
   datetime_variable = "time",
   expected_lag = 1
 )
#> ✔ There are no time lags which are greater than the expected lag: 1 days. By this measure, the timeseries is continuous.
#> [1] TRUE
```

In February our imaginary rain gauge’s onboard computer had a failure.

The timestamp was reset to `1970-01-01`:

``` r
forestprecipitation$february
#>         time rainfall_mm
#> 1 2024-02-01         1.1
#> 2 2024-02-02         0.0
#> 3 2024-02-03         1.4
#> 4 2024-02-04         2.2
#> 5 1970-01-01         3.4
#> 6 1970-01-02         0.6

butterfly::timeline(
  forestprecipitation$february,
   datetime_variable = "time",
   expected_lag = 1
 )
#> ℹ There are time lags which are greater than the expected lag: 1 days. This indicates the timeseries is not continuous. There are 2 distinct continuous sequences. Use `timeline_group()` to extract.
#> [1] FALSE
```

If we wanted to group chunks of our timeseries that are distinct, or
broken up in some way, but still continuous, we can use
`timeline_group()`:

``` r
butterfly::timeline_group(
  forestprecipitation$february,
   datetime_variable = "time",
   expected_lag = 1
 )
#>         time rainfall_mm        timelag timeline_group
#> 1 2024-02-01         1.1        NA days              1
#> 2 2024-02-02         0.0      1.00 days              1
#> 3 2024-02-03         1.4      1.00 days              1
#> 4 2024-02-04         2.2      1.00 days              1
#> 5 1970-01-01         3.4 -19757.04 days              2
#> 6 1970-01-02         0.6      1.00 days              2
```

## Relevant packages and functions

The butterfly package was created for a specific use case of handling
continuously updating/overwritten timeseries data, where previous values
may change without notice.

There are other R packages and functions which handle object comparison,
which may suit your specific needs better. Below we describe their
overlap and differences to `butterfly`:

- [waldo](https://github.com/r-lib/waldo) - `butterfly` uses
  `waldo::compare()` in every function to provide a report on
  difference. There is therefore significant overlap, however
  `butterfly` builds on `waldo` by providing the functionality of
  comparing objects where we expect some changes, with previous versions
  but not others. `butterfly` also provides extra user feedback to
  provide clarity on what it is and isn’t comparing, due to the nature
  of comparing only “matched” rows.
- [diffdf](https://github.com/gowerc/diffdf) - similar to `waldo`, but
  specifically for data frames, `diffdf` provides the ability to compare
  data frames directly. We could have used `diffdf::diffdf()` in our
  case, but we prefer `waldo`’s more explicit and clear user feedback.
  That said, there is significant overlap in functionality:
  `butterfly::loupe()` and `diffdf::diffdf_has_issues()` both provide a
  TRUE/FALSE difference check, while `diffdf::diffdf_issue_rows()` and
  `butterfly::catch()` both return the rows where changes have occurred.
  However, it lacks the flexibility of `butterfly` to compare object
  where we expect some changes, but not others.
- [assertr](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr) - `assertr`
  provides assertion functionality that can be used as part of a
  pipeline, and test assertions on a particular dataset, but it does not
  offer tools for comparison. We do highly recommend using `assertr` for
  checks, prior to using `butterfly`, as any data quality issues will be
  caught first.
- [daquiri](https://github.com/ropensci/daiquiri/) - `daquiri` provides
  tools to check data quality and visually inspect timeseries data. It
  is also quality assurance package for timeseries, but has a very
  different purpose to `butterfly`.

Other functions include `all.equal()` (base R) or
[dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)’s `setdiff()`.
