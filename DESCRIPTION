Description: Verification of continually updating time series data where we
    expect new values, but want to ensure previous data remains unchanged. Data
    previously recorded could change for a number of reasons, such as discovery
    of an error in model code, a change in methodology or instrument recalibration.
    Monitoring data sources for these changes is not always possible. Other unnoticed
    changes could include a jump in time or measurement frequency, due to instrument
    failure or software updates. This package provides functionality that can be
    used as part of a data pipeline, to check and flag changes to previous data
    to prevent changes going unnoticed.
